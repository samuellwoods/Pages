I am 22 years old and from Beaverton, Oregon. I am currently a senior at the University of California San Diego, graduating Fall 2021 with a degree in Mathematics-Computer Science. My favorite programming language is Python because it is concise. When I am not busy I enjoy cycling, sci-fi books and shows, and video games. Currently I am available for work opportunities.
